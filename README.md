#	1.compute compute all the distances between itself and all in dataset.
#	2.take the smallest K(parameter) of them
#	3.count the frequency of  corresponding labels
#	4.use the highest one to predict the class of the test data.
#	5.after traversing,compute the accuracy of the prediction compared with the real labels.
